### Preface

  - The Question: 'What are you doing that your competitors aren't doing yet?' pg xviii. Implies driving the product market, forcing others to follow, and dominating the betterment of customers, employees, and shareholders, which is better for greatness.
  - The 15 points give you the arsenal required to perform the craft, what must be developed is the art of investigating companies, asking the right questions and then asking creative questions based off of the answers of those simpler questions.

### Part 1: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits

  - Modern companies are incentivized to perform for share holders, efficiently utilize research and development and continue to expand with an expanding economy
  - Government is easy to run a deficit should something negative occur in the financial markets/demographically. Deficits like this cause inflation.
      - This means when a depression does occur it is apt to be shorter than some of the great depressions of the past. In fact it is generally followed with enough further inflation to produce the type of general price rise that in the past has helped/hurt certain industries, ie. the business cycle
      - "Major inflationary spurts arise out of wholesale expansions of credit, which in turn result from large government deficits greatly enlarging the monetary base of the credit system"
  - In the wake of a depression either:
      - Business will remain good, in which event outstanding stocks will continue to out-perform bonds, or a significant recession will occur
      - Depression -> "bonds should temporarily outperform the best stocks, but a train of major deficit producing actions can be triggered that will cause another major decline in the purchasing power of bond type investments. ie inflation
      - depression => inflation. The extreme difficulty of determining when bonds should be sold tells us securities are great for insitutions that have dollar obligations that offset them, or to individuals with short term objectives
      - Securities do not provide for sufficient gain to the long term investor to offset profitability for further depreciation in purchase power
 - Best investments = select companies that over the years can grow in sales and profits far more than the industry as a whole.
 - Look for management that has both a determination to attain further important growth and an ability to bring its plans to completion
 - Scuttlebut
      - Method used to find the clues needed to find really outstanding investments
      - competitors, vendors, customers, research scientists, government, executives, former employees
  -15 points
      - 1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
          - "Growth should not be judged on an annual basis but, by taking units of several years each."
          - A successful company must keep good management and maintain a high order of business skill
          - "If a company's management is outstanding and the industry is one subject to technological change and development research, the shrewd investor should stay alert to the possibility that management might handle company affairs so as to produce in the future exactly the type of sales curve that is the first step to consider in choosing an outstanding investment."
      - 2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have largely been exploited?
          = Companies which have a significant growth prosect for the next few years because of new demand for existing lines, but no plans past this are nice for a one time profit, but not for consistent gains over time
          - Well equipped companies have diversified research
      - 3. How effective are the company's research and development efforts in relation to its size?
          - R&D/Revenue & R&D/Total Market-or-Competitors R&D
          - There are discrepencies in pricing of R&D across companies. Some well run companies will get as much as twice the ultimate gain for each research dollar spent as will others.
          - Coordination must be created between projects, product market fit, employees/skill, management
          - The essence of successful commercial research is that only tasks be selected which promise to give dollar rewards of many times the cost of the research
          - The value of a research project is derived from its ability to create a net benefit to the company either directly or indirectly, some creation of a moat through this research in relation to the product is also extremely beneficial
          - An organization in relation to the size of its research activities has produced a good flow of profitable new products during an extended span of time will probably be productive in the future as long as it continues to operate under the same general methods.
      - 4. Does the company have an above average sales organization?
          - It is the making of a sale that is the single most important business activity 
          - It is the making of repeat sales to satisfied customers that is the only benchmark of success
          - Because sales effort does not translate to an easy formula/ratio, it is often neglected
          - Both competitors and customers know the efficiency of a businesses sales organization
          - For steady long term growth, a steady sales arm is vital
      - 5. Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin
          - All the sales growth in the world wont produce the right type of investment vehicle if over the years, the profits do not grow correspondingly
          - profit margin - the number of cents of each dollar of sales that is brought down to operating profit
          - should be studied for a series of years
          - More marginal companies, those with generally higher costs in relation to revenues, tend to see a greater percent increase in prosperous years because their profit margin increases greater than the profit margin of the low cost businesses. However, these earnings also tumble when the prosperous period is up.
          - Marginal businesses are not the best buy for long range investments because they are more volatile to the downside
          - When internal changes are taking place within the company to solidify a greater profit margin, it then qualifies them for a long range investment
          - Usually the best investment gains come from companies having relatively broad profit margins, usually the best in their industry
          - Some companines spend large portions of profit to speed up growth. It is important to make sure this is either research focused, sales focused, or more of any other activity which is being fincnaced today so as to build for the future.
      - 6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
          - "The success of a stock purchase does not depend on what is generally known about a company at the time the purchase is made. Rather it depends upon what gets to be known about it after the stock has been bought. Therefore it is not the profit margins of the past but those of the future that are basically important to an investor"
          - Costs normally go up together
          - Industries which are having a burst in demand tend to show an increased profit margin temporarily, but this is short lived because increased demand is what causes the greater prices, however it also increases competitive capacity which drives prices back down
          - When profit margins of a whole industry rise because of repeated price increases, the indication is not a good one for long range investors
          - Some companies manage to improve profit margins by other means than raising prices, like capital improvement or product engineering departments.
          - The prospective investor should give attention to the amount of ingenuity of the work being done on new ideas for cutting costs and improving profit margins.
          - This is a field in which most top executives will talk about in some detail
      - 7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
          - Strikes are bad for business, but the difference in degree of profitability between company with good personnnel relations and one with mediocre personnel relations is far greater than the direct cost of strikes
          - Culture + leadership = productivity and retention. Those companies with an abnormal labor turnover have greater costs due to constant training.
          - Those companies that have no union or a company union probably also have better labor and personnel relations
          - Good companies that have unions have created good relations with those unions
          - Absence of conflict may not indicate a good relationship, instead it could indicate fear of consequences of conflict
          - Turnover, and waitlist for employment
          - Companies with good labor relations, look to settle grievences quickly
          - The company that makes above average profits while paying above average wages for the area it's located in is likely to have good labor relations
      - 8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
          - The company offering greatest investment opportunities will be one in which there is a good executive climate
          - Promotions are based off ability, not factionalism
          - Great executive climates contain little friction, and ability to problem solve efficiently whether with people inside the company or who are brought from the outside to consult on a given topic
          - Talk to the management
      - 9. Does the company have depth to its management?
          - Small companys with one-man management can do will if they continue to grow and have a contingency plan to replace the executive should an event occur
          - Look for good delegation of authority among managers and a culture of individual ingenuity application to problems
          - There needs to be autonomy for individual leaders to help expand the company, rather than being controlled
          - "Does top management welcome and evaluate suggestions from personnel even if, at times, those suggestions carry with them adverse criticism of current management practices?" If so, go long
      - 10. How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls?
          - Great companies break down their overall costs with sufficient accuracy and detail to show the cost of each small step in its operation
      - 11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competition?
          - Catch all
          - These will be unique to sector, subsector, and business
          - ex. real estate management (lease cost per dollar of sale), insurance costs (management of people to produce a safer work environment can produce greater margins), credit
          - Patent ownership => licensing
          - When large companies depend chiefly on patent protection for the maintenance of their profit margin, it is usually more a sign of investment weakness than strength.
          - Small companies could utilize a patent as a launchpad
          - It is the constant leadership in engineering, not patents, that is the fundamental source of protection
      - 12. Does the company have a short range or long range outlook in regard to profits?
          - Some companies will deliberately curtail max immediate profits to build up good will and thereby gain greater overall profits over a period of 10 years.
          - Ex. Supplier/Distributor Selection
          - The difference in treatment of customers is equally noticable, companies that treat customers exceptionally grow over time
          - The investor wants to target companies with a long range outlook concerning profits
      - 13. In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company require sufficient equity financing so that the larger number of shares then outstanding will largely cancel the existing shareholders benefit from this anticipated growth?
          - Any company that fills out a majority of the 15 points would easily qualify to borrow money, at prevailing rates for their size, up to the top percentage of debt the company can get. Basically the company could easily get money, bought or sold.
          - What is most important is whether the company's cash plus further borrowing ability is sufficient to take care of the capital needed to exploit the prospects of the next several years
          - If borrowing power is not sufficient and equity must be issued, then the attractiveness of the investment depends on careful calculations as to how much the dilution resulting from the greater number of shares to be outstanding will cut into the benefits to present common stockholder that will result from the increased earnings this financing makes possible
          - It is well to consider that all senior convertible issues have been converted and that all warrants, options, etc have been exercised when calculating the real number of common shares outstanding.
          - If a company does not meet the expectations of this point, but does the other 14 then feel free to go ahead because this company will most likely be able to prevail regardless of their financing option. If the company does not meet the other 14 points, but does have financial strength and a strong cash position then avoid the company.
      - 14. Does the managemnt talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well but "calm up" when troubles and disappointments occur?
          - Turbulent times for an investment are expected, the company may have unexpected failures that temporarily set back profits.
          - It is good to understand how a management reacts to a situation like this
          - The investor will do well to exclude from investment any company that whitholds or tries to hide bad news
      - 15. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
          - Invest in companies in which the management have a highly developed sense of trusteeship and moral responsibility to stockholders.
  - What to Buy: Applying this to your own needs
      - The best way = best total profit + least risk
      - "The reason why the growth stocks do so much better is that they seem to show gains in value in the hundreds of percent each decade. In contrast, it is an unusual bargain that is as much as 50% undervalued."
      - The successful investor is usually an individual who is inherently interested in business problems
      - The investors work is so intricate and specialized that there is no more reason why an individual should handle his own investments than that he should be his own lawyer, doc, etc.
      - Some stocks are "institutional grade" trusted by large financial institutions and investors to return a safe yield while mitigating losses in a downturn because it is so fundamentally financially strong, compared to a more marginal stock which could plummet.
      - Some small businesses are justified by having strong products, strong management, and strong scientific personnel pioneering new options for the business. A business like this could explode
      - Select your combination of opportunities 
   - When to Buy
      - Objective is to find the minority of stocks that will have spectacular growth in their per share earnings
      - For spectacular profits, some consideration must be given to timing
      - Dont rely on mainstream narratives, or the mumbo jumbo of macroeconomics
      - An outstanding investment: Companies are working in one way or oanother on the very frontiers of scientific technology, developing various new products or processes from the laboratoru through the pilot plant to the early stages of commercial production, requires a lot of cash, and may not immediately meet expected margins at launch of products
      - the ideal time to enter ownership of a company is at the time of the launch of a new commercial production becasue the large expenses associated with this period of time cans stifle other investors
      - run up of stock price when the new product/process is announced, sell off when difficulties arise with manufacturing, extended sell off with potential brief rally occurs as expenses get eaten for production and sales of the new product, at this point (bottom) buy, normal sales production is enough to turn profit once break even is reached
      - Identify situations where an event occurs that brings earnings down, while in the backgroud the management is running a stellar risk management/development exercise in the background to improve the conditions of the business
      - A worthwhile improvement in earnings is coming in the right sort of company, but that this particular increase in earnings has not yet produced an upward move in the price of that company's shares
      - You dont want to be focused on the stock market or the business environment, rather on what the individual company is going to do in relation to business in general
      - Daily cost average (or even over greater, more extended periods of time)
      - forces - phase of the business cycle, trend of interest rates, the overall governmental attitude towards investment and private enterprise, the long range trend to more and more inflation, and new inventions and techniques as they affect old industries

  - When to sell and when not to
      - Obtaining the greatest total dollar benefit from the investment dollars available
      - Reason 1. Sell when a mistake has been made in the original purchase and it becomes increasingly clear that the factual background of the particular company is, by a significant margin less favorable than originally believed. Cut your losses quick before they bleed you out
      - Losses should always scrupulously be reviewed for flaws, but dont let them hang over your head
      - Reason 2. Sales should always be made of the stock of a company which, because of changes resulting from the passage of time, no longer qualifies in regard to the 15 points to the same degree it initially did.
      - Management loses interest/lack of performance, lack of momentum
      - when these problems occur, especially concerning management, the stock should be sold immediately
      - After extended periods of spectacular growth, the growth prospects of a company/market are exhausted and there is no room left for them to outperform the market. These shares should also be sold
      - Ask yourself "whether at the peak of a business cycle, the comparative per share earnings (after allowances for stock dividends and stock splits but not for new shares issued for additional capital) will probably show at least as great an increase from present levels as the present levels show from the last known peak for general business activity. If the answer is yes then hold, if no then sell"
      - Reason 3. Switch into a situation with seemingly better prospects
      - One must scrupulously assess all elements of a situation like this
      - **Once a stock has been properly selected and has borne the test of time, it is only occasionally that there is any reason for selling it at all**.
      - Dont disturb a position that will be worth a great deal more in the future
   
  - Dividends
      - A dividend is just a passing of extra cash from earnings to the stockholder
      - Retained earnings really have no impact on the stockholder. When they do its either because the company is just hoarding cash, or an inefficient management is increasing an inefficient operation in an effort to increase their salary
      - The 15 points filter out companies with characteristics like these
      - When shareholders are not affected by retained earnings, the situtation is usually one in which an investment into an asset is needed to remian competitive that doesnt directly affect earnings, or when depreciation does not account for inflation and the depreciated value of an asset is less then what it will eventually cost to replace it
      - If the stockholder is saving any part of their income rather than spending it and if they have their funds invested in the right common stocks, then they are better off with the management of the company reinvesting the retained earnings rather than receiving a greater dividend

  - Five Dont's for investors
      - Dont buy into promotional companies.
          - An established company, with at least two to three years of commercial operation and one year of operating profit, is what to look for rather than a new start up. The investor can look at all aspects of the operation.
          - When a company is still in the promotional stage, all an investor or anyone else can do is look at a blueprint and guess what the problems and the strong points may be. Greater probability of error.
          - There are enough oportunities available in established companies that an investor should avoid promotional companies unless they have the resources to aid the promotional company in many other ways besides just investment
      - Don't ignore a good stock just because it is traded 'over the counter'. 
          - Normally, most buying should be confined to stocks which can be sold should a reason arise for such selling.
          - some confusion regularly rises regarding stocks that arent readily available on exchanges, which are over the counter stocks
          - Make sure to pick the right broker
      - Dont buy a stock just because you like the tone of its annual report
          - Dont only trust the annual report language/tone, dig deeper. PR stunts are real
      - Don't assume that high price at which a stock may be selling in relation to earnings is necessarily an indication that further growth in those earnings has largely been discounted in the price
          - People generally use price-earnings ratio to use in considering how far ahead a stock is actually discounting future growth.
          - If a company has sustained a great performance with a regularly high P/E then it shouldn't be a surprise if they predict to continue growth and in fact do continue growth.
      - Don't quibble over eighths and quarters
          - If you must due to extremely large order sizes, then find a reliable broker dealer
  - Five More Don'ts For Investors
      - Dont overstress diversification
          - Some companies have sufficient internal diversification
          - The breadth and depth of a company's management personnel and how often they change is important to gague the need for diversifcation
          - holdings in highly cyclical industries inherently need greater diversification
          - All investments might be confined solely to the large entrenched type of properly selected growth stock. In this case, the investor may want a minimum goal of 5 stocks in all. This means that he would not invest over 20% of his total original commitment in any one of these stocks. No more than a moderate amount of overlapping between product lines. 
          - Some or all of the investments may fall into the category of stocks about midway between the young growth companies with their high degree of risk and the institutional type of investment. Good management team, volume of business between 15 and 100 mil per year and rather well entrenched in the industries. You may want to allocate a smaller percentage to this group of investment
