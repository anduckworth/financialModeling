### Part 1: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits

  - Modern companies are incentivized to perform for share holders, efficiently utilize research and development and continue to expand with an expanding economy
  - Government is easy to run a deficit should something negative occur in the financial markets/demographically. Deficits like this cause inflation.
      - This means when a depression does occur it is apt to be shorter than some of the great depressions of the past. In fact it is generally followed with enough further inflation to produce the type of general price rise that in the past has helped/hurt certain industries, ie. the business cycle
      - "Major inflationary spurts arise out of wholesale expansions of credit, which in turn result from large government deficits greatly enlarging the monetary base of the credit system"
  - In the wake of a depression either:
      - Business will remain good, in which event outstanding stocks will continue to out-perform bonds, or a significant recession will occur
      - Depression -> "bonds should temporarily outperform the best stocks, but a train of major deficit producing actions can be triggered that will cause another major decline in the purchasing power of bond type investments. ie inflation
      - depression => inflation. The extreme difficulty of determining when bonds should be sold tells us securities are great for insitutions that have dollar obligations that offset them, or to individuals with short term objectives
      - Securities do not provide for sufficient gain to the long term investor to offset profitability for further depreciation in purchase power
 - Best investments = select companies that over the years can grow in sales and profits far more than the industry as a whole.
 - Look for management that has both a determination to attain further important growth and an ability to bring its plans to completion
