  - The 15 points give you the arsenal required to perform the craft, what must be developed is the art of investigating companies, asking the right questions and then asking creative questions based off of the answers of those simpler questions.

### Part 1: Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits

  - Modern companies are incentivized to perform for share holders, efficiently utilize research and development and continue to expand with an expanding economy
  - Government is easy to run a deficit should something negative occur in the financial markets/demographically. Deficits like this cause inflation.
      - This means when a depression does occur it is apt to be shorter than some of the great depressions of the past. In fact it is generally followed with enough further inflation to produce the type of general price rise that in the past has helped/hurt certain industries, ie. the business cycle
      - "Major inflationary spurts arise out of wholesale expansions of credit, which in turn result from large government deficits greatly enlarging the monetary base of the credit system"
  - In the wake of a depression either:
      - Business will remain good, in which event outstanding stocks will continue to out-perform bonds, or a significant recession will occur
      - Depression -> "bonds should temporarily outperform the best stocks, but a train of major deficit producing actions can be triggered that will cause another major decline in the purchasing power of bond type investments. ie inflation
      - depression => inflation. The extreme difficulty of determining when bonds should be sold tells us securities are great for insitutions that have dollar obligations that offset them, or to individuals with short term objectives
      - Securities do not provide for sufficient gain to the long term investor to offset profitability for further depreciation in purchase power
 - Best investments = select companies that over the years can grow in sales and profits far more than the industry as a whole.
 - Look for management that has both a determination to attain further important growth and an ability to bring its plans to completion
 - Scuttlebut
      - Method used to find the clues needed to find really outstanding investments
      - competitors, vendors, customers, research scientists, government, executives, former employees
  -15 points
      - 1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
          - "Growth should not be judged on an annual basis but, by taking units of several years each."
          - A successful company must keep good management and maintain a high order of business skill
          - "If a company's management is outstanding and the industry is one subject to technological change and development research, the shrewd investor should stay alert to the possibility that management might handle company affairs so as to produce in the future exactly the type of sales curve that is the first step to consider in choosing an outstanding investment."
      - 2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have largely been exploited?
          = Companies which have a significant growth prosect for the next few years because of new demand for existing lines, but no plans past this are nice for a one time profit, but not for consistent gains over time
          - Well equipped companies have diversified research
      - 3. How effective are the company's research and development efforts in relation to its size?
          - R&D/Revenue & R&D/Total Market-or-Competitors R&D
          - There are discrepencies in pricing of R&D across companies. Some well run companies will get as much as twice the ultimate gain for each research dollar spent as will others.
          - Coordination must be created between projects, product market fit, employees/skill, management
          - The essence of successful commercial research is that only tasks be selected which promise to give dollar rewards of many times the cost of the research
          - The value of a research project is derived from its ability to create a net benefit to the company either directly or indirectly, some creation of a moat through this research in relation to the product is also extremely beneficial
          - An organization in relation to the size of its research activities has produced a good flow of profitable new products during an extended span of time will prbablh be productive in the future as long as it continues to operate under the same general methods.
      - 4. Does the company have an above average sales organization?
          -
